I love programming, I'm like one of those programmers who several days a week go to bed late for programming. My interests/knowledge are focused on web/mobile and Frontend applications (although I have knowledge of Backend, so I could make Fullstack applications if necessary). I also have a special interest in the visual section, testing and architecture.
Regarding the products in which I have actively worked, they are ecommerce (CMS) with a lot of SEO.
The future of technology is always uncertain because new paths are constantly being opened, but today I am interested in working on web 2.5 (or web 3), or Augmented Reality. I am not closed to this and I can consider any other field that is presented to me.
